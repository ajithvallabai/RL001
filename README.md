Develop custom reinforcement learning models and deploy in hardware

Prerequisties:
- Python
- Reinforcement learning basics

Phase 1 (2 month)

- Develop four custom RL environments/games using pygame, python, stablebaseline3 eg: snakegame, ping pong etc (Try to develop own games as much as possible)

Phase 2 (3 month)

- Develop and deploy in line following robot with RL
- Develop and deploy in a robot that goes inside a lane without dashing with RL
- Develop a car that can touch all free points (where obstacles are not there) in a floor without dashing any obstacle (Need to explore methods for sensor data)
